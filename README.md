# 2025 SALES ANALYSIS
## Description
This Excel based project analyses 2025 sales transactions to summarize revenue outcomes and sales activity across regions, products, and categories. The analysis emphasizes units sold, unit pricing, and revenue calculations, including total revenue and key summary measures such as sum, maximum, and minimum revenue, to present a clear snapshot of sales performance for the year.

## Project Overview
This project provides a year focused breakdown of 2025 sales performance, emphasizing how prices, sales and customer transactions contribute to overall revenue outcomes. The analysis centres on products, categories, and revenue distribution across regions over time.
Key metrics such as total revenue, cumulative revenue, and revenue extremes (highest and lowest sales values) are used to highlight revenue concentration, variability, and consistency throughout the year. The project offers a concise analytical view of sales behaviour & basic financial insight generation.

## Findings
The 2025 sales analysis shows that the business generated a total revenue of ₦302,680,445, indicating solid overall performance during the year. However, the wide gap between the maximum revenue (₦50,000,000) and minimum revenue (₦59,500) highlights significant variability in sales outcomes.
Sales performance varies notably across regions. The West region leads in both units sold and total revenue, while the North region records higher unit prices, suggesting a more premium pricing structure or higher-value product mix. Revenue is therefore concentrated in a few key regions.
Product and category analysis reveals that Laptops and Phones are the primary revenue drivers, while other product categories contribute smaller portions to total revenue. This indicates reliance on a limited set of core products.
Customer analysis shows that a small number of customers account for a large share of total revenue, pointing to customer concentration. Similarly, sales representative performance is uneven, with a few representatives generating significantly higher revenue than others.
Overall, the findings indicate strong revenue generation, but also reveal concentration and performance variability across regions, products, customers, and sales representatives.

## Conclusions
The 2025 Sales Analysis demonstrates that revenue performance is driven primarily by key regions, core products, and high-value customers. While the business achieved substantial total revenue, the presence of wide revenue disparities and concentration across multiple dimensions suggests potential exposure to risk if performance in these key areas declines.
To strengthen long-term performance, management should focus on:
- Expanding revenue contributions from underperforming regions and products
- Reducing reliance on a small group of customers and sales representatives
- Reviewing pricing strategies to balance volume and value across regions
Overall, the analysis provides a clear, data-driven snapshot of sales performance in 2025 and offers valuable insights to support strategic decision-making, revenue stability, and sustainable growth.
